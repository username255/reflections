When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  At the times I'd like to share the thing or collaborate on it,
  or just to store it externally, so there will be backups,
  plus I'll be able to contribute from my other devices.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  First of all you might have different version of files
  at that current moment and you'll probably need to merge those two.
  The worst case there is that you'll need to review all the diffs and come up with the final version
  and you don't really want to do that while you're in the middle of something.
